## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program and primarily focus on studying the physics governing the lower half of the ocean. Overall, I just enjoy working with data to understand the physics governing our Earth's ocean and how they may change in a warming world.
In particular, I uses models and observations to study the past and future circulation of heat and chemicals in the abyssal ocean. 

Before starting my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Data Science from the University of California, Irvine.
