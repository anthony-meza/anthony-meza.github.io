## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, studying the physics of the deep ocean (> 2000 meters) using models and observations. My research focuses on how human-driven warming affects the deep ocean and what that means for its role in storing heat and carbon.
Before starting my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Data Science from the University of California, Irvine.  

## Research Interests 
- abyssal ocean circulation
- ocean heat uptake
- data assimilation 

## Outreach and Leadership

  - JP ASKÂ Graduate Application Mentor (2021 - Present)
  - MIT-WHOI Joint Program Student Representative and Vice President (2022 - 2024)
  - MIT-WHOI Summer Math Refresher Instructor (2023 - 2024)
  - Co-organizer of the Graduate Climate Conference (2023)
