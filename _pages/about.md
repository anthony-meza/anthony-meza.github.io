## About Me

I am a Physical Oceanography PhD candidate in the MIT–WHOI Joint Program. My research focuses on how global ocean circulation and its drivers influence the distribution of heat and other tracers. I am particularly interested in identifying, quantifying, and understanding abyssal circulation variability over the modern era through numerical simulations and observations.

Before starting my PhD, I earned an A.S. in Mathematics from Fullerton College and a B.S. in Mathematics from the University of California, Irvine.
