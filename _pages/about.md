## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, studying the physics of the deep ocean ($\leq 2000$ meters depth) using models and observations. My research focuses on how human-driven warming affects the deep ocean and what that means for its role in storing heat and carbon. Broadly speaking, I am interested in any projects that involve combining data and models (e.g., state estimation or data assimilation) to improve our understanding of the future of Earth's climate. 

Before starting my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Data Science from the University of California, Irvine.  

Almost all of the code I write for my work ends up [on my GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-meza) at some point, feel free to check it out and/or follow me!
