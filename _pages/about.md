## About Me
I'm a PhD candidate in the MIT-WHOI Joint Program, studying the drivers of variability in the deep ocean $$(\geq 2000 \textrm{ meters})$$ using models and observations. In particular, I'm interested in understanding how the deep ocean changes on annual, interannual, and decadal timescales as well as testing our ability to observe that variability.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Mathematics and Data Science from the University of California, Irvine. I'm interested in any projects that involve combining data and models to improve our understanding of the future of Earth's climate. 

Almost all of the code I write for my work ends up [on my GitHub](https://github.com/anthony-meza) (at some point)!
