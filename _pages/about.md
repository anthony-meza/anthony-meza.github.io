I am a physical oceanographer who utilizes models and observations to study abyssal ocean circulation. Born to two Peruvian immigrants and raised in Southern California, as a child I never expected to go to graduate school. However, my strong interest in mathematics, programming, and later, physics led me to pursue higher education where I hoped to learn how to apply these interests to study how Earth's ocean has changed over the recent decades.
